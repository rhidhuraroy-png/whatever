# ðŸ§± BlockScore â€“ Immutable Game Leaderboard on Celo

### âš¡ Project Description

This project is ideal for **beginners in Solidity** who want to learn how to:
- Store and retrieve structured data on-chain
- Use mappings, structs, and arrays
- Emit and listen to blockchain events

### ðŸŽ® What It Does
- Each player can **register their name and score**.
- Once recorded, the score **cannot be changed** (immutable record).
- Anyone can **view all players and their scores**.
- Developers can **build off-chain leaderboard UIs** using the contractâ€™s public functions.
